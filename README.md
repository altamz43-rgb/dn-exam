## What we provided:

- Development folder: contains the PSD file
- Preview folder: contains the mock-ups for the template and the elements

## Requirements:

- Convert the PSD file into a running Wordpress theme.
- Your code should make use of the latest available coding techniques (BEM and SMACSS) and technologies that you are capable of applying.
- You may use pre-processors (optional) that compiles your source code into .html (e.g. pug, jade, haml), .css (sass, scss, less, stylus), and .js (browserify, coffee, babel and on).
- Follow the exact fonts and colours used in the mock-up.
- All elements, modals, links should be functional and contains dummy data. If provided in the preview, please use it. Otherwise, please make up something for it.
- You will be responsible for extracting the graphics or assets needed for your template from the PSD file.
- You will need to provide us the GitHub URL so we could clone your repository for review and don't forgot to include your local Database.
- Bonus Points: Template should be responsive and viewable in Tablet and Desktop. No Mobile view for now. If you want to apply a mobile view for it please do so if you have time.

## What to do:

- Before starting the test, create a repository in GitHub. Create your account if you don't have one yet. Do not commit anything yet.
- Create a file called my.log. When youâ€™re ready to begin coding, please push my.log file with a text "IN" in it as your initial commit and a commit message "IN". This will indicate your start time. And when you take a break push the my.log file with a text and a commit message "BREAK", "BACK" when you resume and "OUT" when you finish. Pushing development files excluding my.log file should be done the usual way.
